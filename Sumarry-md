# Reflection – Google Pay Product Analysis

## What this analysis helped me understand
Working on this product analysis made me realize that building a successful application is not only about features, but also about clarity, timing, and user confidence.

While analyzing Google Pay, I noticed how small design decisions such as button placement, confirmation screens, and error messages play a big role in user trust.

## Constraints during analysis
- The analysis is based on personal usage and observation
- No internal product data or analytics were available
- Assumptions were made from a student learning perspective

## Learning outcome
This exercise improved my ability to observe real-world applications critically and document technical and product-related insights in a structured way.

This repository represents a learning exercise, not a commercial or official product review.
